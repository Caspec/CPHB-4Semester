### Functional Programming

Functional programming languages are specially designed to handle symbolic computation and list processing applications. Functional programming is based on mathematical functions. Some of the popular functional programming languages include: Lisp, Python, Erlang, Haskell, Clojure, etc.

Functional programming languages are categorized into two groups:

- Pure Functional Languages − These types of functional languages support only the functional paradigms. For example − Haskell.

- Impure Functional Languages − These types of functional languages support the functional paradigms and imperative style programming. For example − LISP.
